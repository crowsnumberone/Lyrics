[Verse 1]
Woke up 'cause the light poured in
Day two, let the flood begin
Day one left me in my bed (In my bed)
I can barely remember it
Heart shattered in a thousand ways
They tell me pain gonna come in waves
They tell me I'm gonna be okay
I'm still waitin' for the first to break

[Pre-Chorus]
Why would You give and then take him away?
Suddenly end, could You not let it fade?
What I would give for a couple of days
A couple of days
[Chorus]
Is it just across the Jordan?
Or a city in the stars?
Are you singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart

[Verse 2]
I just can't make sense of this
Everything is so dissonant
Somebody said he was meant for this
But I'm just straight missin' him
I wanna wake up to your laugh at two
Catch you when you steal my shoes
Say good mornin', afternoon
Talk you through those "Alex blues" (Alex blues)
Listen to your latest beats
Talk about what the lyrics mean
Venmo you another loan (Another loan)
See you do your second show

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you'd turn, you would turn it around (Turn it around)
Thought that you had time to straighten it out (Straighten it out)
Told me that you were my prodigal son
But this isn't home

[Chorus]
Is it just across the Jordan?
Or a city in the stars?
Are you singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are?
Well, until this show is over
And you run into my arms
God has you in Heaven
But I have you in my heart
I have you in my heart

[Bridge]
Did he see You from a long way off (Did he see you?)
Runnin' to him with a father's heart? (Runnin' to him)
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Did he see You from a long way off
Runnin' to him with a father's heart?
Did You wrap him up inside Your arms
And let him know that he's home?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
Is it just across the Jordan?
Or a city in the stars? (City in the stars)
Are you singin' with the angels?
Are you happy where you are? (Happy where you are)
Well, until this show is over
And you run into my arms (Run into my arms)
God has you in Heaven
[Outro]
21 years makes a man full-grown
21 years, what a beautiful loan
21 years, I loved every one
Thank You, Lord, for my beautiful son
